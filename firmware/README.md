# Deprecation Notice

As of November 13th, 2020, this firmware is considered DEPRECATED and should no longer be used.

If you purchased an official Ploopy Kit and received a notice of shipment prior to November 13th, your kit includes this firmware. If your kit shipped after this date, it comes with [QMK](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware).

This firmware will still work with PCBs of version R1.005, and the firmware in [R1.004 branch](https://github.com/ploopyco/trackball/tree/r1.004) will still work with PCBs of version R1.004 and previous. But you really ought to switch to QMK. It's the shit.
